# Digipick in React
Starfield's digipick minigame built in react.

## How to Play

This project was built to replicate the lockpicking minigame in Starfield. You are provided with:

- A difficulty selector to choose between the 4 available difficulties.
  - The default is novice.
  - Each difficulty provides additional locks to unlock and more lockpicks to choose from.

- A list of lockpicks on the right side of the screen that you can select from.

- A move left, move right, and slot button to take actions on the select lockpick.

## Installation
To use this project:
1. Clone this repository.
2. ```npm install```
3. ```npm start```

## Future Enhancements
Currently, the core development is complete but there are features I would like to add in the future:
  - Auto-slot and undo placement functionality.
  - Improved UI.
  - Audio cues for correct and incorrect placement.
  - Animation for unlocking.
